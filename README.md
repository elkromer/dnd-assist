# pyenv
A generic python project to understand project structure and develop scripts.

I'm testing python 2.7 and 3.5 on windows and occasionally ubuntu and raspberry pi's

Please do not expect:

    Accurate documentation
    Support for other platforms
    Any particular function working
    A proper user-facing API
    Any technical support from me

* Note: to make development easier, symlink this project to C:\Python\Lib\sites-available on windows or /usr/local/lib/python on Unix.
